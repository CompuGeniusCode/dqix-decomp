// word, never the hand-picked {r1,r2,r3} stm groupings the target uses -- BYTEDIFF, wrong
// shape, not a register-colour issue. Reference itself has this as hand asm in both
// pokediamond and SonicRushAdventure-Decomp; the stm register sets here (paired/tripled
// reuse of r1-r3 chosen per group, not simply "all live regs") is exactly the
// register-block tell no compiler emits.
